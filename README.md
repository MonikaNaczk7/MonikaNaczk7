*"From sport the greatest thing I've learned is the discipline to achieve goals."* - Desmond Green

<h2>üîç Why Data Analyst?</h2>
I started playing basketball when I was 10. It's been 20 years since I started, and 10 years as a professional player. In September 2024, I decided to rebrand myself and start developing a new career. I have always been competitive and I like challenges, so my next life goal is to become a DATA ANALYST.


     
Sport taught me a lot about discipline and hard work. That's what got me to one of the best leagues in Europe, in Spain, and it‚Äôs also what brought me here, as I find my own way to fill up my portfolio with projects. Thanks to sport, I became 'addicted' to self-development and focusing on details. Working under pressure only makes me more concentrated, and above all‚Ä¶ teamwork makes the dream work!
